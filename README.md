## Project Description
The dataset was gotten from Data.World. The dataset was used to investiagte and discover factors that influence happiness in different regions. Those factors were then  investigated to discover how much influence they have on the people's happiness. For the visualization, charts such as pie chart, scatter plot, bar plot were used. Heatmap was also used to investigate the correlation among variables. One of the major challenge I faced was deciding what chart type to use.
